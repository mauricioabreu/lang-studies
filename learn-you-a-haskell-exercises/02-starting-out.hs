-- Find the penultimate element in list l
penultimate :: [a] -> a
penultimate l = last (init l)

-- Find the element at index k in list l
-- For example: "findK 2 [0,0,1,0,0,0]" returns 1
findK :: Int -> [a] -> a
findK k l = l !! k

-- Determine if list l is a palindrome
isPalindrome :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
isPalindrome l = l == reverse l

{-
 - Duplicate the elements in list xs, for example "duplicate [1,2,3]" would give the list [1,1,2,2,3,3]
 - Hint: The "concat [l]" function flattens a list of lists into a single list. 
 - (You can see the function definition by typing ":t concat" into the interpreter. Perhaps try this with other variables and functions)
 -
 - For example: concat [[1,2,3],[3,4,5]] returns [1,2,3,3,4,5]

{-
 - Imitate the functinality of zip
 - The function "min x y" returns the lower of values x and y
 - For example "ziplike [1,2,3] ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']" returns [(1,'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
